<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Math+CS rising junior undergraduate at [Jiangsu University and Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/news/arcadia-and-jiangsu-university-celebrate-10-years-of-collaboration/). I began conducting research in my freshman year, joining the group led by [Prof. Zhe Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhe-Liu-28) and [Prof. Jun Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=cDVzxXsAAAAJ), with co-advisor [Prof. Victor S. Sheng (IEEE Senior Member)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0epc43IAAAAJ&hl=en) at Texas Tech University, [Prof. Lu Liu](https://le.ac.uk/people/lu-liu) at the University of Leicester, [Prof. Shuhui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-JxBSYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Qingming Huang (IEEE Fellow)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=J1vMnRgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

My previous research primarily foucuses on Trustworthy Machine Learning System for Medical Vision and Multimodal Learning. Specifically, it can be categoried into: (1) Construction of the world's first Multi-task Medical Image Benchmark Dataset, currently under reviewed by **Medical Image Analysis (SCI Q1, IF: 10.7)**. (2) Medical Image Segmentation with Noisy Labels, our work is currently under reviewed by **IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (SCI Q1, IF: 8.9)** and **Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (SCI Q1, IF: 7.5)**. (3) Vision-language Models that proposes a Curriculum Learning framework for efficient and robust Medical Report Generation, currently under reviewed by a double-blind conference (CCF B). (4) Trustworthy Machine Learning System to address the imbalances from both sample and modality perspective, currently under reviewed by a double-blind conference (CCF A).

I am a self-motivated individual currently seeking a remote research internship in cutting-edge Computer Vision and Multimodal Learning. Additionally, I have obtained a 5-year F-1 USA Visa (2024-2029).
