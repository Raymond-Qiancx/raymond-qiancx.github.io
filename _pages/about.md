<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science at Jiangsu University, currently working as a Research Intern specializing in Multimodal Perception and Cross-modal Interactions, supervised by [Prof. Shuhui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-JxBSYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Qingming Huang (IEEE Fellow)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=J1vMnRgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Previously, I collaborated with Prof. Zhe Liu and Prof. Jun Chen, with co-advisor [Prof. Victor S. Sheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0epc43IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Lu Liu](https://le.ac.uk/people/lu-liu), on developing Robust Machine Learning System for Medical Vision.

# Research Interests
My long-term vision is to develop efficient, robust and generalizable machine learning system capable of perceiving, understanding and interacting with the world through multimodal information from both 2D and 3D perspectives. Specifically, my previous research focuses on these topics:
- ***Enhancing the Robustness and Generalization of Medical Segmentation Models: Learning from Sparse and Noisy Labeled Data*** 
- ***Rethinking the Learning Strategies of Multimodal Foundation Models: from a Data Perspective***
- ***Exploring the Nature of Cross-Modal Cooperation: Quantifying the inherent Correlations and Interactions from a Disentangled Perspective***

Despite significant progress in 2D vision models, relying solely on 2D pixel-level input cannot capture the full complexity of the surrounding 3D world. Spacial information, such as depth, geometric structures, pose and orientation, plays a crucial role in achieving a more comprehensive perception and understanding of the environment. Integrating these 3D aspects enables more accurate scene interpretation, object recognition, and interaction, bridging the gap between artificial perception and real-world understanding. Based on my previous research in Multimodal Learning, my future research will focus on exploring Text-driven or LLM-guided 3D Generation, Reconstruction, Editing and Manipulation, along with related topics.

Dynamic Curriculum for Multimodal Rebalance

**Under Reviewed by Double-blind CCF-A Conference**

**Chengxuan Qian**<sup>*</sup>, Kai Han<sup>*</sup>,  Shuhui Wang<sup>&dagger;</sup>, Jun Chen<sup>&dagger;</sup>, Chongwen Lyu, Yuqing Song<sup>&dagger;</sup>, Victor S. Sheng<sup>&dagger;</sup>, Zhe Liu<sup>&dagger;</sup>.

- Existing multimodal learning approaches often face under-optimization challenges due to inherent imbalances from varying sample quality and discrepancies in modality representation . To this end, we propose a dynamic curriculum that quantifies inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives, adaptively prioritizing multimodal samples based on their current difficulty relative to the model's capabilities and the effectiveness of modality collaboration.
